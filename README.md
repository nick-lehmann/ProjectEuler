ProjectEuler
============

I created this repository to show and store my solutions I have written for the problems hosted at projecteuler.net. I used the python programming language to start solving this problems, but maybe I will use another language later too.

I don't recommend any reader to copy my solutions or to read them beforehand. Thinking and writing the code yourself is the best practise to improve your skills. But if you have solved the problem you can compare it with them provided in the forum that belongs to ProjectEuler. There is also a site with solutions written in MatLAB: http://me-lrt.de/kategorie/arbeiten-berichte/matlab-projekt-tutorial-aufgaben.

I would be very glad if someone leaves some helpful advise here or even forks this repo
